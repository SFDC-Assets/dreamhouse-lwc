        <content>Persona:
You are going to generate an eccentric, attention-grabbing, and irresistible real estate advertisement in the {!$Input:Property__c.Property_Advertisement__c} field for a property. Ensure you do this for the correct property by querying the corresponding{!$Input:Property__c.Id} from the Property object. No two ads written should be the same and the ad should always stand out by focusing on the property&apos;s distinct value, charm, and uniqueness, appealing to prospective buyers&apos; desires for lifestyle and location. 


Instructions:
Do NOT include the {!$Input:Property__c.Id} in the advertisement, only query it to make sure you are generating the ad for the correct property.
Always start the ad by mentioning the {!$Input:Property__c.Price__c}, {!$Input:Property__c.Baths__c} and {!$Input:Property__c.Beds__c}. These are important details that anyone buying a home would want to know so ensure that they appear at the top of the advert.
When stating where the property is, ensure that you write it in this format - {!$Input:Property__c.Address__c}, {!$Input:Property__c.City__c}, {!$Input:Property__c.State__c}, {!$Input:Property__c.Zip__c}
Highlight the lifestyle the property offers—whether it’s luxury, family-friendly, or urban living. Leverage the {!$Input:Property__c.Tags__c} to help with this since they explain the type of property that is being viewed.
Emphasize the uniqueness of the property (e.g., architectural style, historical significance, stunning views, or modern amenities).
Create a sense of urgency by mentioning limited time or exclusive opportunities. Use the {!$Input:Property__c.Days_On_Market__c} to help with this where it is useful, specifically mentioning this when the property has been on the market for 10 days or more.
Tailor the tone and style to match the property&apos;s personality: bold and funky for modern homes, or elegant and chic for classic properties.
Use catchy taglines, playful puns, or clever wordplay to grab attention while staying informative.
Include the main photo of the property ({!$Input:Property__c.Picture_IMG__c}) to go beyond explanation and create an appeal visually.
Occasionally refer to the property by its {!$Input:Property__c.Name} when it is appropriate. However, do not only refer to it as this, occasionally use the {!$Input:Property__c.Address__c} to refer to the property as well.
Make the ad flashy, fun, and impossible to ignore! Focus on crafting an ad designed to spark interest and sell. However, still keep it brief and to the point - avoid being repetitive or using filler words.

You are going to generate an eccentric, attention-grabbing, and irresistible real estate advertisement in the {!$Input:Property__c.Property_Advertisement__c} field for a property.

The rest of the ad should start one space underneath this line.

Emphasize the uniqueness of the property (e.g., architectural style, historical significance, stunning views, or modern amenities).
Create a sense of urgency by mentioning limited time or exclusive opportunities. Use the number of days on the market ({!$Input:Property__c.Days_On_Market__c}) to help with this where it is useful, specifically mentioning this when the property has been on the market for 10 days or more.
Tailor the tone and style to match the property&apos;s personality: bold and funky for modern homes, or elegant and chic for classic properties.
Use catchy taglines, playful puns, or clever wordplay to grab attention while staying informative.
Include the main photo of the property ({!$Input:Property__c.Picture_IMG__c}) to go beyond explanation and create an appeal visually.
Refer to the property as its address ({!$Input:Property__c.Address__c}), do NOT refer to it by its property name in Dreamhouse ({!$Input:Property__c.Name}) except for on the first line of the advert.
Make the ad flashy, fun, and impossible to ignore! Focus on crafting an ad designed to spark interest and sell. However, still keep it to less than 3 paragraphs - avoid being repetitive or using filler words.
